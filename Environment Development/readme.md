Project
===  

Setting up a Gym OpenAi environment to simulate a computer playing itself at tic-tac-toe
 and a mouse moving through a maze

The tictactoe solution has been optimized to run 6000 games in 78 secs.  
The CheeseMaze problem has been solved and is in process of adding variance to 
the mazes and still being solvable

* template  
Inside the template folder is a folder named `Project`. This can be used to create
a new custom environment from scratch. It contains a readme with instructions to 
set up the environment and already contains the necessary file-hierarchy.
